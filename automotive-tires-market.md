<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bias Tire</li><li>Radial Tire</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive tires market is primarily divided into two types: bias tires and radial tires. Bias tires have plies that crisscross, providing flexibility and good load-carrying capacity but offering less stability and tread wear compared to radial tires. Radial tires, on the other hand, have plies arranged at right angles to the tread, resulting in enhanced grip, fuel efficiency, and longer lifespan. As a result, radial tires are more popular for passenger vehicles, while bias tires are often used in specific applications like trailers and motorcycles.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The External Cardiac Pacemakers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Chamber Pacemakers</li><li>Dual Chamber Pacemakers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The external cardiac pacemakers market includes two main types: single chamber pacemakers and dual chamber pacemakers. Single chamber pacemakers are designed to stimulate either the right atrium or the right ventricle, mainly used for patients with bradycardia or atrioventricular block. In contrast, dual chamber pacemakers stimulate both the atrium and the ventricle, coordinating heartbeats more effectively and providing better hemodynamic support. Both types are critical in managing arrhythmias and improving patients' quality of life.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydro-processing Catalysts Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydrotreating</li><li>Hydrocracking</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hydro-processing catalysts market encompasses two primary types: hydrotreating and hydrocracking. Hydrotreating involves removing impurities such as sulfur and nitrogen from petroleum fractions, enhancing fuel quality and stability. Hydrocracking, on the other hand, breaks down larger, heavier hydrocarbon molecules into lighter, more valuable products like diesel and jet fuel. Both processes are crucial for optimizing refining operations, improving product yield, and meeting stringent environmental regulations, thus driving the demand for advanced catalysts in the refining industry.</p></p>

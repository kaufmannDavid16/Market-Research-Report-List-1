<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cutting Balloons Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-Compliant Balloons</li><li>Non-Compliant Balloons</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Cutting Balloons market is divided into two main types: semi-compliant balloons and non-compliant balloons. Semi-compliant balloons can adapt to varying pressures, providing flexibility during procedures but may not maintain shape under high pressure. Non-compliant balloons, on the other hand, maintain a fixed shape and pressure, offering precise control for targeted interventions. These distinctions cater to different medical applications, with semi-compliant balloons being suitable for softer lesions and non-compliant options preferred for more rigid structures requiring stronger dilation.</p></p>

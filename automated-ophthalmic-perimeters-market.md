<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automated Ophthalmic Perimeters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Static Ophthalmic Perimeters</li><li>Kinetic Ophthalmic Perimeters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Automated Ophthalmic Perimeters market is primarily divided into two types: Static Ophthalmic Perimeters and Kinetic Ophthalmic Perimeters. Static Ophthalmic Perimeters assess visual field by presenting fixed points of light across a patient's field of vision, allowing for detailed mapping of visual field defects. In contrast, Kinetic Ophthalmic Perimeters measure peripheral vision by moving a light stimulus toward the center of the visual field until it is detected, providing dynamic assessment of visual sensitivity. Both types are essential for diagnosing and monitoring eye conditions.</p></p>

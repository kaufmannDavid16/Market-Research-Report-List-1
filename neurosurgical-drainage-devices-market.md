<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neurosurgical Drainage Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Shunt Types</li><li>Anti-Siphon Device</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Neurosurgical drainage devices encompass various types, primarily focusing on shunt systems and anti-siphon devices. Shunt types, such as ventriculoperitoneal or ventriculopleural shunts, are designed to redirect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the brain to the abdominal or pleural cavity, alleviating pressure. In contrast, anti-siphon devices serve to prevent excessive CSF drainage due to gravitational pull, maintaining optimal intracranial pressure. Both types are critical in managing conditions like hydrocephalus, ensuring patient safety and improving clinical outcomes.</p></p>
